# Steps taken 
Understanding the Data: I started by reviewing the data and analyzing the relationships between the three tables provided.

Data Cleaning: I checked for duplicate values and null values. In the rating column, I found some null values, which I replaced with zero. Alternatively, another approach could be to replace null values with the mean rating for the specific user, depending on the project requirements.

Data Merging: I merged the Order Details table with the Cooking Sessions table and added the required columns, such as session duration and session rating, using the XLOOKUP formula.

Quick Insights: I used Pivot Tables to generate quick insights into the data, including average session duration, percentage of cancellations, completed orders, and user meal preferences.

Data Visualization: I represented the data using tables, bar charts, and pie charts to effectively convey the results.

Summary Sheet: Finally, I added a Summary Sheet in the Excel workbook to consolidate key insights and findings.
